    "<image>\nYour task is to classify the given image into one of these 11 classes: ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck', 'none of these classes'] and assign confidence values for your prediction to each class.\nYou can classify the given image into 'none of these classes': if you cannot classify the given image into any of the other classes given, if you are not sure whether an image belongs to one of the given other 10 classes, or if you think you need other classes other than the given other 10 classes to classify the given image.\nThe following are guidelines for your response. Please respond according to these guidelines.\n- You should provide your confidence for each class between 0.00 and 100.00.\n- The condfidence value can be expressed as a float.\n- The class you've assigned the max confidence should be your prediction.\n- Your confidence should be above 0.0 in at least one of the 11 classes given. It is not allowed to assign 0.0 confidence to every class.\n- You should provide your confidence in the 11 classes given, even if your prediction is 'none of these classes'.\n- Your prediction should be in the given 11 classes. You are not allowed to predict the given image into any other classes than the 11 given classes.\n- There is 'none of these classes' in the given 11 classes. This means that your prediction should be 'none of these classes' if your prediction is not in one of the other classes given.\nStrictly follow the guidelines above.\nHere are two examples of your response. The first one is when a given image is predicted into the given 10 classes except 'none of theses classes'. The second one is when a given image is predicted into 'none of these classes'.\nPlease respond with the following examples format:\nExample 1) when a given image is predicted into the given 10 classes except 'none of these classes'\n--------------------------------------------------\nPrediction: cat\nConfidence: {'airplane': 41.27, 'automobile': 64.61, 'bird': 64.65, 'cat': 88.8, 'deer': 59.87, 'dog': 50.22, 'frog': 13.89, 'horse': 11.57, 'ship': 15.43, 'truck': 17.18, 'none of these classes': 63.79}\n--------------------------------------------------\nExample 2) when a given image is predicted into 'none of these classes'\n--------------------------------------------------\nPrediction: none of these classes\nConfidence: {'airplane': 74.1, 'automobile': 53.0, 'bird': 82.9, 'cat': 91.01, 'deer': 82.0, 'dog': 69.49, 'frog': 53.25, 'horse': 44.89, 'ship': 8.44, 'truck': 39.94, 'none of these classes': 99.13}\n--------------------------------------------------\nThese above examples are confidences for two different images. You should provide confidences for only one case as only one image is given.\nWhen you provide your answer, your answer format should be the same as the format between the dashed lines in the examples.\nStrictly adhere to the examples format provided above. Do not deviate from the above format.\n": {
